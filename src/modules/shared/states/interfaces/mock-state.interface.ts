 * @remarks
 * This type creates a representation of a function's signature based on its return type, parameters, and
 * `this` context. It's particularly useful for creating mock implementations, decorators, or wrappers
 * that need to maintain the same signature as the original function.
 *
 * By using this type, you can ensure type safety when implementing functions that need to match
 * an existing function's signature exactly, including its return type, parameter types, and `this` binding.

 * // Original function
 * function greet(name: string): string {

 * // Implementation with the same signature
 * const mockGreet: ImplementationType<typeof greet> = function(name) {
