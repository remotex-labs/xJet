/**
 * Base class for implementing custom reporters.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `AbstractReporter` defines lifecycle hooks that can be implemented
 * by concrete reporter classes to customize how test results are reported.
 *
 * Reporters receive structured event messages during test execution,
 * including suite start/end, describe/test assertions, logs, and finalization.
 *
 * Each method is optional (`?`) and may be implemented depending on
 * the reporterâ€™s needs (e.g., console logging, file output, JSON reporting).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class ConsoleReporter extends AbstractReporter {
 *   log(log: LogMessageInterface): void {
 *     console.log(`[LOG] ${log.message}`);
 *   }
 *
 *   suiteStart(event: StartMessageInterface): void {
 *     console.log(`Suite started: ${event.suiteName}`);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
